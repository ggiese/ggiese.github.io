    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Giese absolutely loves math and computers.  The only thing he likes
      more than his beloved diciplines is guiding students through their own
      journey in the math and sciences.  You are forutnate to have such a caring
      guide.

    <p>
      Sixteen years ago, Mr. Giese began teaching mathematics at West High School.
      He prepared for this by obtaining a degree from Bakersfield College, followed
      by a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics at Cal State Bakersfield.  He earned 
      his teaching credential at Point Loma Nazarene University, where he followed 
      up with a Masters Degree in Administration.  After all of the years of 
      education, the most important lesson he learned was that he really 
      appreciates all of his students who come through his door everyday with 
      their excitement for life, learning and growing.
